## Notes

I've looked everywhere I can think of in the GitHub docs to better understand this bullet you sent:

- Describe licensing and privacy features for GitHub Actions, Learning Lab, and codespaces

The most applicable thing I've been able to find is here:

https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/learn-github-actions/security-hardening-for-github-actions

But that only covers GitHub Actions, and only covers hardening, not necessarily privacy.  I may need a bit more guidance here.

Same with licensing.  I suspect this has to do with limits (what you can and can't do, and how many times), not necessarily licensing from a repository perspective (i.e., MIT, BSD, Apache 2)

Again, if you could point me to some docs, I'd appreciate it.
